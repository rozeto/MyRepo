Dear Hiring team, 

I would like to express my interest in the position of Senior Technical Writer. 

I have fifteen years of experience in technical writing for software products. My attention to detail (my colleagues call me the formatting nazi), skill to structure complex concepts into navigable information, ability to translate developerâ€™s language to normal people language, together with the fact that your product is not unfamiliar to me, make me believe that I can bring value to a company I hold in high regard. 

Because conciseness is valued in this field, I would like to thank you for your time and consideration and hope to hear from you soon. 

Kind regards, 
rosie
